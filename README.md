# GPX splitter

Splits `.gpx` files by number of points.

The Garmin StreetCross app on my Yamaha XSR900GP only accepts files with around 30 points. For the [TT2000](https://www.tt2000.org/), each day needed hundreds of points, so I needed a way to break them into smaller files. This tool does exactly that: it splits `.gpx` files into multiple parts ðŸŽ‰
